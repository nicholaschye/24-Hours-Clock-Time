# 24-Hours Clock Time

This project is a simple Java program designed to manipulate and display time in 24-hour format.  
It demonstrates core programming concepts such as:

- String parsing and splitting  
- Time conversion between seconds and HH:MM:SS  
- Arithmetic with modulus operator  
- Formatted output using printf

## Purpose

This program was created as part of personal learning and practice in handling time calculations using Java.  
It aims to strengthen skills in string manipulation, arithmetic logic and formatted input/output.

## Features

- Reads time input in HH:MM:SS 24-hour format  
- Reads an integer representing seconds to add to the input time  
- Calculates the updated time after adding seconds  
- Outputs the new time in proper zero-padded HH:MM:SS format

## Files

- Main.java — Main Java source file containing the full program code

## Sample Input/Output

Input:
13:45:30
5000

Output:
15:08:50

## How to Run

1. Compile the program:
   javac Main.java
2. Run the program:
   java Solution
3. Enter the time and seconds when prompted.
